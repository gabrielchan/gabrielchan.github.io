- (COMM-EDU) Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss
  - Context: Interesting book that was reccomended by a dear friend in regards to job negotiation
  - Helped: This book not only goes over how to negotiate and get what you want, but also how to properly listen and communicate to find a mutually agreeable middle ground. As a developer I will be negotiating for my job, ticket sizes, and technical decisions, I want to be equipped to do this effectively

  - Context: As I am starting my first data engineering role, I wanted to make sure I don't make beginner mistakes
  - Helped: Content reminded me to focus on more than just the code, but also to bring 'big picture' and communication aspects from my consulting days
