# Introduction
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a "social contract" on how an application speaks and responds to other applications, often exchanging data and functionality. Key benefits of APIs include:

- Enabling applications to work with each other without directly coupling  
- Allowing for applications written in different languages to interact (within reason)

# General

- A **client** is anything that attempts to make a request to something that can accept API requests  
- A **server** is the host of the respective API’s business logic  

Broadly speaking, whenever a client speaks to the server; they want to do 1 of 4 actions:

| Action  | HTTP Method | Idempotent |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Create  | POST        | No         |
| Read    | GET         | Yes        |
| Update  | PUT         | Yes        |
| Delete  | DELETE      | Yes        |

Most famous/popular API architecture styles will map these actions to HTTP methods.

For a client to communicate to the server, they often need to refer to the **Endpoint**, which is a specific network address or interface (typically a URI/URL, IP address, or socket) where communication occurs between client and server.

An endpoint can be seen as a door/entrypoint to a server.

How endpoints are structured is generally a bit different per API architecture. For example:

- REST APIs tend to use endpoints to represent a **resource** (or object).  
- GraphQL is a single endpoint where a query in the request body is provided to define the action.  
- WebSockets keep an open and persisted connection.

### RESTful APIs Example:

- `GET /users` : Retrieve a list of users.  
- `POST /users` : Create a new user.  
- `GET /users/{id}` : Retrieve a specific user by ID.  
- `PUT /users/{id}` : Update a specific user by ID.  
- `DELETE /users/{id}` : Delete a specific user by ID.

Clients will send a request corresponding with what action and result they are looking for. The server will send a response in return. How the request and responses are structured generally depends on the API architecture-style that's being used.

A request from the client will generally contain:

- HTTP Header  
- Endpoint URL  
- Additional parameters required (e.g., some sort of ID when doing a DELETE, or the query in GraphQL)

A response from the server will contain:

- **Status Code** that indicates the result of the request:  
  - 200-level: Action requested was a success  
  - 400-level: Request-level error (e.g., request syntax error)  
  - 500-level: Server-level error (e.g., server down)

## Types of APIs

- **Public API:** APIs that are available for anyone to use  
  - Note that Public APIs generally do require authentication to enforce rate limits, quotas and/or pricing - as well as track stats  
  - **Example:** Riot Game’s Public API for game related data they want to expose for external developers to use (often you need a Riot Games Account to access this)

- **Private API:** APIs that are meant for companies/organizations to use internally; often used for internal systems to communicate with each other  
  - **Example:** Autodesk’s Data Streaming Self-Service API to interact with Kafka and Flink service

*CopyPasta Source:* https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep49-api-architectural-styles

### REST

- Proposed in 2000, REST is the most used style. It is often used between front-end clients and back-end services. It is compliant with 6 architectural constraints.  
- The payload format can be JSON, XML, HTML, or plain text.  
- Every API endpoint is its own HTTP request.

**Common Use Cases:**

- General Use  
- Want easy to setup communication between services  
- Client can tell server to conduct “actions”

### GraphQL

- Proposed in 2015 by Meta. It provides a schema and type system, suitable for complex systems where the relationships between entities are graph-like.  
- Single endpoint where clients query for a large set of data.  
- GraphQL is not a replacement for REST; it can be built upon existing REST services.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Client needs dynamic data (what the client wants may change per request)

### Web Socket

- A protocol that provides full-duplex communications over TCP.  
- Clients establish web sockets to receive real-time updates from the back-end services.  
- Unlike REST, which always “pulls” data, web sockets enable data to be “pushed”.  
- Full-Duplex Communication: Persisted bidirectional data transfer between two services (can be simultaneous).

**Common Use Cases:**

- Chat services

### Webhook

- Used by third-party asynchronous API calls.  
- When a third-party payment service is done, it notifies the payment service if the payment is successful or failed.  
- Webhook calls are usually part of the system’s state machine.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Third Party Integration

### gRPC

- Released in 2016, gRPC is used for communications among microservices.  
- gRPC library handles encoding/decoding and data transmission.

### SOAP

- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.  
- Its payload is XML only, suitable for communications between internal systems.

## Security and Authentication

At a high-level, APIs often require some sort of authentication when calling the API.

- **Authentication** asks “Who are you?”  
- **Authorization** asks “What are you allowed to do?”

| Security Method       | Description                                                                                   | Comments                                                                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Key              | Static key sent alongside Client-request to prove that the Server owner has given this Client the key | If your key is stolen then the API is compromised. Best for personal APIs only.    |
| Credentials          | Encoded username and password passed alongside the Client-request that the Server verifies      | Outdated, can be intercepted. Use with HTTPS only. Best for personal projects.     |
| Token-Based Auth     | Client is provided a temporary token after initial authentication; used for some period          | Usually paired with strong authentication initially for security.                  |
| JSON Web Tokens (JWT)| Token-based auth with encoded user info, digitally signed so they don’t need server verification | Often paired with OAuth.                                                          |
| OAuth / Bearer Token | Bearer token provided on successful authentication; tokens are often temporary                   | Delegates access.                                                                 |
| Session-Based Auth   | After login, a session_id is created and returned; compared to a cache for fast access           | Best for server side rendered apps.                                               |

## API Documentation

The standard is to use one of these tools to document how to use an API and what is its expected outcome — a human-readable “contract” of what the API is capable of:

- Swagger → Human-readable and machine-understandable API contracts  
- OpenAPI Spec → Human-readable and machine-understandable API contracts  
- Postman → Good for testing and collaboration  
- Redoc  
- DapperDox

## Development Features and Concepts

### Pagination

- Dividing large datasets into smaller chunks (pages).  
- Pages managed by offset (e.g., page number + number of items).  
- Reasonings: Reduce server load and delivery latency, client-side rendering ease.  
- Example: Search results show “first 50 results” with option for next 50.

### URL, Query, Path Parameters

- API endpoints often include URL with query/path parameters to filter, sort, paginate, or specify user_id for flexibility and performance.

### Idempotency

- API calls with identical parameters return the exact same result.  
- Especially important for RESTful APIs to allow safe retries without side effects.

| HTTP Method | Idempotent?                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| POST        | Not guaranteed (creating resources usually isn’t idempotent) |
| GET         | Yes                                           |
| PUT         | Yes                                           |
| DELETE      | Yes                                           |

### API Versioning

- Differentiates between versions of API calls to protect consumers from breaking changes.  
- Usually done with a prefix in the URL, e.g., `/v1/products`, `/v2/products`.

### Multi-Tenant vs Single-Tenant

- **Multi-Tenant:** One instance serves multiple clients, logically separated by tenant IDs. Easier maintenance, shared updates.  
- **Single-Tenant:** One instance serves a single client; used where isolation/security is critical (e.g., finance, healthcare).

## Performance and Optimization

### Caching

- Store results of common API calls in cache for faster response and reduced load.  
- Examples: Client-side caches, server-side caches (Redis), CDN/Edge caching.

### Rate Limiting

- Limits how frequently clients can call an API to prevent overload and protect against DDOS attacks.

### Load Balancing

- Distributes client requests among servers to prevent overload of any one server.  
- Common methods: round-robin, least-connections.

### Pagination

- Also a performance optimization to reduce volume of data returned.

### Indexing

- Sorting/partitioning data for faster queries, usually a DB concept but impacts API performance.

### Scaling

- Vertical Scaling: Increase power of a single node.  
- Horizontal Scaling: Add more nodes to the system.

## Design Patterns

- **Async vs Sync**  
  - *Asynchronous*: Client doesn’t wait for server response before continuing.  
  - *Synchronous*: Client waits for server response.

- **Webhooks**  
- **Batch Processing**  
- **Message Queue**

## Summary
Consider that we want to create an API that interacts with some internal services like Apache Kafka and Apache Flink. This can be done using:
- Java and Spring Boot Application
- Docker

Out of the box - the Spring Boot app would contain the Web Server (Tomcat internally and part of the framework) as well as the ability to understand what endpoints are associated to what business logic in your Spring Boot app code

By packaging this in a Docker container; the Spring Boot code, app and dependencies are packaged in. Other external dependencies (say your business logic requires a external library) is also packaged here. This container can be deployed / spun up (either locally, directly in a server or on the cloud). Then the container will "turn on" the Spring Boot app and will stay on so long the container is active. This container will now be hosting the Web Server within the Spring Boot app and will be actively listening for HTTP requests and directs it to the endpoints to handle the API logic (CRUD operations)
